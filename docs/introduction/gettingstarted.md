AnyQ is a base library that facilitates any implementation of it's interfaces to interact with a Message Queue to produce "Jobs" for "Handlers" to receive and process.  Before using AnyQ, you must first choose an implementation library to use for you backing queue.  In this tutorial we will be using the default implementation, [AnyQ.Queues.Msmq](https://github.com/DoublePrecisionSoftware/AnyQ.Queues.Msmq).
